# DailyLogAppProject
Welcome to the Daily Log App!
This app is basically a journal entry for your daily thoughts, custom-tailored to your thoughts on a page!

The Daily Log App is a project programmatically designed to invoke the use of OOD principles on MVC architecture

When hitting the "Send" button, you are always prompted to choose a directory in which to save the file.
Be sure to always save the file in your drive, "D:", and only directory, "D:".
DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE FILE WHEN SAVING!

Enjoy!

To run, type java -jar daily_log_app_vALPHA_1.2.jar in your command prompt or terminal and *not* by double-clicking the app.
