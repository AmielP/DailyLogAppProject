# DailyLogAppProject
Welcome to the Daily Log App!
This app is basically a journal entry for your daily thoughts, custom-tailored to your thoughts on a page!

The Daily Log App is a project programmatically designed to invoke the use of OOD principles on MVC architecture

Update 1.2:
- Bug fixes
- Users can now choose where to save their log file in any directory. 

Update 1.2.1:
- Bug fixes
- Users can now select the directory of their choice to create a new log or open an existing log in that directory.
  
When hitting the "Send" button, you are always prompted to choose a directory in which to save the file.
To continue opening the previous the log, be sure to only save the file in the same directory it was created.
To create a new daily log chain, just save the log file in a different directory.

DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE FILE WHEN SAVING!

DO NOT DUPLICATE THE FILE WITH THE SAME NAME AS THE OTHER LOG FILES!

Select any hard drive except C:, because access to the C: drive is denied.

To run, type java -jar daily_log_app_vALPHA_X.jar in your command prompt or terminal and *not* by double-clicking the app (X means version).


Enjoy!
